Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) support:
===

GCM is significantly more capable than SimplePush, which is a good
thing, and we can take full advantage of this fact.

GCM Documentation:
<http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html>

In order to use GCM, you'll need to configure the following:

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/project (Your account
will need project creation privileges.)

1.a If you don't already have a project, create a new one. (Note, this
may become a billable expense.)

1.b For the project, click on the "APIs & Auth" section

1.c Under "APIs" find "Google Cloud Messaging for Android" and
activate it

1.d Under "Credentials" find Public API access, and create a new key

1.d.1 You may wish to set the IPs to a limited set that includes your
SimplePush server (this limits who can send GCM requests)

1.d.2 Note the API Key that's generated. Store that value in the
"config.toml" as propping.api_key

1.e You may wish to also set propping.dry_run if you don't wish GCM to
send out notifications to devices.

It is recommended that separate keys be created for:
* Production
* Development
* Cross Platform Integration Testing & Development
* Load Testing

This will prevent overuse of a given key from impacting other systems
reliant on that particular key.

NOTE: You will need to provide the Project Number to clients. You can
get this value by going to the Google Developers Console, and going to
the Project Dashboard. The Project Number is currently located near
the top of the page above the "Project Dashboard" header.


Client Use
---
On the client side, an app will call the
GoogleCloudMessaging.getInstance(this).register(SENDER_ID) and get the
registration id. (See the GCM sample programs for how to best do this.
<http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/client.html>)

Once the client has the registration id, it includes it in the "hello"
packet to the server. For example, presuming that the returned
registration ID is the fictitious "abc-registration-id":

    {"msg":"hello",
     "uaid": ""
     "channelIDs": [],
     "connect":{"type":"gcm", "regid":"abc-registration-id"}
    }

The server will then send a "message-to-sync" GCM notification to the
client.

Additional Notes
---
The "Complimentary" (free) GCM service allows for 1 request per second
per user, with a maximum of 1,000,000 requests per day total. This is
enough for small projects and development, but if you plan on running
any service beyond a few hundred users, you're going to burn through
this limit fairly quickly.
